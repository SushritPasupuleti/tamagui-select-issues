# tamagui-select-issues

Steps to reproduce [issue](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/issues/256):

1. Run `cd select-issues && yarn native`

2. Lauch an iOS emulator (iPad and iPhone) alongside an Android VM.

3. Interact with the select components on the homescreen. (On Portrait mode devices, only the last select component works, on tablets, the Sheet throws an error attached in the issue).
